If you are adding a jar to the archive, then, please, upload the "universal" jar which you can take from here: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8795dcb3-ad94-4a14-905c-13811d680c18)

You also have to update the `versions.json` file. But you don't have to update `README.md`, `changelogs.json`. To generate a version information for `versions.json` you can use our simple tool located here: https://github.com/CRModders/VersionsGen

Thank you!
